# Perceptron-python

A playground for modeling Perceptron learners in python.

### History
* McCullock and Pitts neuron (1943)
  - first concept of a simplified brain cell
* Rosenblatt Perceptron (1957)
  - proposed an algorithm that would automatically learn the optimal weight coefficients
    that are then multiplied by the input features to determine if the neuron fires
